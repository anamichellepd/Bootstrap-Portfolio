                            Hello, My name is Ana Michelle Pineda. I am 29 years old. I was born in Veracruz, Mexico.
                            I've lived in
                            many
                            cool places such as Mexico City, Cabo San Lucas, Barcelona, Czech Republic, and since 2014
                            I've lived in
                            Irvine, Orange, Costa Mesa, Palm Desert and currently Huntington Beach.</p>

                    <div class="col">
                        <p class="text"> My dad is Mexican and my mom is American. They live in Mexico with their dog,
                            Milly
                            and their 5 cats. My brother is 31 years old and lives in Alexandria, Virginia and is
                            looking to move to
                            Colorado soon. Laura, my sister, is 26 and currently going to school to become a physical
                            therapist. My
                            cat
                            Penny has been my little bestie for 3 years now. I think bestie is said loosely, we are
                            frenemies too, I
                            don't think I've ever forgiven anyone for making me bleed so much. </p>

                    for
                    about 5 years now, but decided to shake things up by taking this course. Currently having a lot of fun
                    learning and enjoying the rush of solving a difficult puzzle. Although doing this homework I've been
                    thinkin coding consists of an elaborate combination of feelings. I can go from neutral to wanting to
                    throw my laptop, to extreme excitement, to crashing wanting to take a nap, possibly all within an hour.
                    But I like it, I'm having fun doing this.
